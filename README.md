Simulating Highly Aberrated Diffuser Cameras with Small Convolutional Kernels

For my final year project for UCL Computer Science, I investigated different optimisation techniques to further improve the perfomance of the DiffuserCam data set.

Here, the Point Spread Function (PSF), will be applied to deconvolve the image, in parts rather than as a whole.
